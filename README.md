# ARD (Auto Radar Detector) Project

## <span style="color:blue">Introduction</span>
The ARD project aims to integrate radar detection into a remote-controlled (RC) plane, enhancing its navigational capabilities by detecting and mapping objects in its flight path. This provides real-time data on surrounding obstacles.

## <span style="color:blue">Project Overview</span>
The ARD uses radar to transmit radio waves and analyze reflections, determining the distance, speed, and direction of objects. It's useful for aerial surveillance, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring.
